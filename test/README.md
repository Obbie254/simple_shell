# Simple Shell Project
This my simple shell, that I'm creating from my understanding of the C programming Language and its concepts.
Shell can be consindered to be of type RPEL. The RPEL process.
R - read line from stdin
P - parse - break line into arguments
E - execute command along with arguments
L - loop the process until user exits
Description of the code files contained is as follows:
my_shell.c - main fxn of the program
interactive_shell.c - fxn that excutes when shell is interactive
get_input.c - fxn reads line from stdin
make_args.c - fxn splits the input line into an array
